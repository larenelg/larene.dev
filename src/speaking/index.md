# Speaking

I love to speak and share my knowledge with the community. I've presented at YOW!, NDC, DDD, local Meetups, and internally at companies.

Here are some of my recorded talks:
- [Creating Inclusive Apps with React Native @ YOW! Connected Melbourne 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT7ckLeA4oM&t=1243s)
- [Sixty minutes to accessibility @ NDC { Sydney } September 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvT8Y43HbC0)
- [Mentoring: A two-way street @ YOW! CTO Summit 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTq4iK787wY)
